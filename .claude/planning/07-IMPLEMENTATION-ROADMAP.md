## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Gradio limitations for React Flow | Early technical spike | Fall back to iframe embedding |
| Performance issues with large graphs | Profiling in sprint 2 | Implement virtualization |
| WebSocket scaling | Load testing sprint 9 | Fall back to SSE if needed |

### Resource Risks
| Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Single developer bottleneck | Good documentation, modular code | Community contributions |
| Time overruns | 20% buffer in each sprint | Cut Phase 4 features to v2.0 |

### Adoption Risks
| Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Low community interest | Regular updates, demo videos | Focus on enterprise use cases |
| Competition releases similar features | Fast iteration, open-source advantage | Pivot to unique differentiators |
